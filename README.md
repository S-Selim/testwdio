Getting Started with WebdriverIO

WebdriverIO is a popular test automation framework used to automate browser testing. It is built on top of the WebDriver protocol, which allows it to communicate with various browsers and perform actions on them. This guide will help you get started with WebdriverIO and provide step-by-step instructions on how to set it up.

Prerequisites
To get started with WebdriverIO, you will need the following:

Node.js (version 10 or later)
NPM (version 5 or later)
Installing WebdriverIO
You can install WebdriverIO using NPM, the Node.js package manager. Follow the steps below to install WebdriverIO:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it.
Run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project:
csharp
Copy code
npm init -y
Run the following command to install WebdriverIO:
css
Copy code
npm install webdriverio --save-dev
Writing your first test
Once you have installed WebdriverIO, you can write your first test. Follow the steps below to create a new test:

Create a new JavaScript file in your project directory and name it test.js.
Add the following code to the test.js file:
javascript
Copy code
const { remote } = require('webdriverio');

(async () => {
const browser = await remote({
capabilities: {
browserName: 'chrome'
}
});

await browser.url('https://www.google.com');
const title = await browser.getTitle();
console.log(`Title: ${title}`);

await browser.deleteSession();
})();
This code will open Google in the Chrome browser, retrieve the page title, and log it to the console.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory.
Run the following command to execute the test:
bash
Copy code
npx wdio ./test.js
This command will run the test and output the title of the Google page to the console.

Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully set up WebdriverIO and written your first test. You can now use WebdriverIO to automate browser testing and improve the quality of your web applications.
